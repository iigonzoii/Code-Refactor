 # Code Refactor

## Motivation
I wanted to make sure i felt comfortable replicating one of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers. 

## Why this project?
I had to find a solution to my above mentioned motivation. I produced this Refactor in order to satisfy and prove to myself that I was able to take what I've learned and turn it into real world application.

## What problem are we solving?
* Using semantic HTML elements is going to optimize our site for search engines
* Our code will be easy to follow even without an in depth background in coding
* Future edits as accessability standards change will be easier to implement since the structure and flow of the page is up to date with todays accessability standards.

## What I learned
* Using semantic html is actually my new preferred way of coding. 
* I love how much sense it makes.
* No longer will one element, div for instance, represent mutliple different areas of the website. 
* I can use section, article, aside, and more once I get into more dense coding.
* mistakes due to the clutter and repitition of the same elements used over the whole website will be elimanted, saving me time :).

## What should make this project stand out?
My read me of course, code refactoring is something very common. I think the fact that I want to implement proper semantics into my coding, and my reasons behind that decission, should illustrate my understanding of the importance behind accessible code.
